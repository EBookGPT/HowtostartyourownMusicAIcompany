# Chapter 14: Collaborating with Music Industry Partners

Welcome back to our journey on how to start your own Music AI company. In the previous chapter, we discussed the importance of marketing and promoting your Music AI company. We hope you’ve learned some valuable lessons in creating an effective marketing plan to help drive traffic and generate new customers.

In this chapter, we will focus on the benefits of collaborating with industry partners. By working closely with established industry professionals, you have the opportunity to create strategic partnerships that can accelerate your company's success.

We are excited to be joined by our special guest, Troy Carter. Troy is a music industry veteran with over 20 years of experience. He has worked with artists such as Lady Gaga and Meghan Trainor and has also served as an advisor to major companies, including Spotify and Cross Culture Ventures.

Troy will share some insights into how he has collaborated with Music AI companies to create mutually beneficial relationships. We will also explore how to build partnerships with music labels, publishers, and other industry professionals.

But before we dive into the benefits of collaboration, let's take a look at some essential code samples you'll need to know to get started. 

## Essential Code Samples:
 
### 1. Querying the Spotify API
 
To build an effective Music AI product, you will need access to music data. The Spotify API provides access to a vast library of music and metadata. Here's a sample code that shows how to query the Spotify API to retrieve a list of new releases. 

```
import spotipy
from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyClientCredentials

client_credentials_manager = SpotifyClientCredentials(client_id='YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
                                                      client_secret='YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET')
sp = spotipy.Spotify(client_credentials_manager=client_credentials_manager)

new_releases = sp.new_releases(country='US', limit=10)
for album in new_releases['albums']['items']:
    print(album['name'], '|', album['artists'][0]['name'])
```

### 2. Creating a Recommendation Engine

One of the essential features of a Music AI product is the ability to provide personalized recommendations to the user. Here's a code snippet that demonstrates how to create a simple recommendation engine using the k-nearest neighbor algorithm:

```
from scipy.spatial import distance

def knn(user_ratings, k=3):
    # Define the similarity metric to use
    sim_metric = distance.cosine

    # Compute the distance between the user's ratings and the others in the dataset
    distances = []
    for other_user, other_ratings in user_ratings.items():
        distance = sim_metric(user_ratings, other_ratings)
        distances.append((other_user, distance))

    # Sort and return the k nearest neighbors
    distances.sort(key=lambda tup: tup[1])
    return distances[:k]
```

With these code samples available, let's dive into collaborating with industry partners and how it can benefit your Music AI company.
# Chapter 14: Collaborating with Music Industry Partners

The story below is an Alice in Wonderland-inspired tale on partnering with industry professionals to create a thriving Music AI company. 

Once upon a time, Alice found herself lost in a world of music. She had a passion for technology and loved to gather and analyze data to help create personalized recommendations for people searching for new music. Alice had a dream of starting her own Music AI company, but she knew that she couldn't do it alone. 

As she wandered deeper into this musical wonderland, she stumbled upon a strange and colorful building. The door creaked open with a loud screech, and Alice found herself standing in a room filled with top music industry professionals. Troy Carter was in attendance, and Alice's heart beat faster as she admired his many achievements in the music world.

"You want to create a Music AI company?" Troy asked with a sparkle in his eye. "Collaborating with industry professionals can help cultivate creative partnerships that can take your company to the next level."

Excited about the prospect of working with music industry professionals, Alice asked for some guidance on how to get started. 

Troy smiled, "The first step is to create a list of potential partners. Look for industry professionals who share a similar vision as you and your company. This can include music publishers, labels, and artists."

Alice nodded, "But how do I reach out to them?"

Troy replied, "Start by attending music industry events and joining online communities. Network with people and get your name out there. Introduce yourself and your company to others. You can also reach out directly to people you admire and respect. The worst they can do is say no."

Alice listened closely and thanked Troy for his advice. She left the room in a daze, feeling more confident than ever about the potential of her Music AI company.

As Alice wandered the wondrous world of music, she realized that the partnerships with industry professionals can provide many benefits. Collaborating with music labels and publishers can help with licensing agreements and access to data. Working with artists can help create more personalized recommendations and help her AI better understand musical preferences. 

Alice couldn't be more excited about the potential of partnering with industry professionals. She continued to build new relationships, and her Music AI company flourished like never before. 

And that, dear readers, is the power of collaborating with music industry partners. It can take your company from good to great and allow you to find success in this wondrous world of music.
## Explanation of Code

The essential code samples discussed in this chapter are designed to help you get started with creating your own Music AI company. We've shared two code samples: one that demonstrates how to query the Spotify API to retrieve a list of new releases, and another that demonstrates how to create a recommendation engine using the k-nearest neighbor algorithm.

The code used in the Alice in Wonderland trippy story is a non-functional example meant to provide a glimpse into the capabilities of Music AI. The story focuses on the importance of collaborating with music industry professionals to create a successful Music AI company.

In the first code sample, we import the `spotipy` and `SpotifyClientCredentials` modules to authenticate credentials and access the Spotify API. We then use the `spotipy` module to query the Spotify API and retrieve a list of new releases. Finally, we iterate through the list of new releases and print the album name and artist name for each.

The second code sample demonstrates how to create a recommendation engine using the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. This algorithm is commonly used for collaborative filtering and personalization. We define a function called `knn` that takes in a dictionary of user ratings and finds the k nearest neighbors to the user based on cosine similarity. The code compares the user’s ratings to other users, then computes the distance between them. Finally, it sorts and returns the k nearest neighbors based on the distances.

These code samples offer a glimpse into the possibilities of Music AI and demonstrate the importance of querying music data and creating personalized recommendations. By working with industry professionals as discussed in the Alice in Wonderland trippy story, Music AI companies have the potential to create strategic partnerships that can accelerate their success.
