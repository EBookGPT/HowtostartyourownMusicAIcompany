# Chapter 3: Music AI Business Models

Once upon a time, Alice found herself in a land filled with musical creatures of all shapes and sizes. She heard the most beautiful melodies and rhythms that she had never heard before. She started to follow the sound and found herself in an enchanted room.

In the room, she saw a group of musical animals discussing their business models for their Music AI companies. Alice was fascinated by their conversation and decided to join them.

The first animal she met was a Unicorn who was running a Music AI company that focused on song recommendation. The Unicorn had a unique and straightforward business model; they used AI to analyze user's listening history and recommended personalized music.

The second animal Alice met was a phoenix who ran a music streaming business using Music AI. The Phoenix's business model was to use AI to enhance user experience by creating and managing personalized playlists based on the user's mood and occasion.

Alice then met a mermaid who ran a Music AI company that focused on music composition. The mermaid's company used AI-powered music tools to help musicians compose music to their specific needs.

Finally, Alice met a group of musical rabbits who ran a Music AI company that helped generate royalties for musicians. The rabbit's business model was to use AI to track musician's music rights and collect royalties on their behalf.

Alice was fascinated by the variety of Music AI business models and realized that selecting a suitable business model is crucial to make a Music AI company successful. She thanked the musical creatures and headed back home with a mind full of ideas.

After returning home, Alice researched and developed a Music AI business model that catered to her unique needs and objectives. She realized that choosing the right business model for a Music AI company could impact its success significantly.

In the end, Alice successfully built her own Music AI company that combined the recommendations, streaming, composition, and royalties services. Her business model helped her to stand out from the competition and become successful.

Remember, dear reader, selecting a viable business model for your Music AI company is crucial; it can make or break your success. Choose wisely!
# Code to Resolve the Alice in Wonderland Trippy Story

The Alice in Wonderland Trippy story introduces the reader to the different Music AI business models used in the industry. These business models need to be translated into code to create a successful Music AI company. Let's take a look at some code examples that can be used to implement some of these business models.

## Song Recommendation
The first Music AI business model is song recommendation. This model uses AI to analyze user's listening history and recommends personalized music. To implement this model, we need a recommendation system that uses collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering is a technique that recommends items based on user's preferences and patterns. Here's an example of Python code that uses collaborative filtering to recommend songs to users:

```
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

# Load the user-song-playcount data
data = pd.read_csv("user_song_playcount.csv")

# Transform the dataset
df = data.pivot_table(index='user_id', columns='song_id', values='playcount')

# Fill NaN values with 0
df.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Calculate the cosine similarity
cos_sim = NearestNeighbors(metric='cosine', algorithm='brute')
cos_sim.fit(df.values)

# Get nearest neighbors for the user
def recommend_songs(user_id, n_songs):
    distances, indices = cos_sim.kneighbors(X=df.loc[[user_id]].values, n_neighbors=n_songs+1)
    
    # Get song ids and playcount of nearest neighbors
    song_ids = [df.columns[i] for i in indices.flatten()][1:]
    playcount = [df.loc[user_id][i] for i in song_ids]
    
    # Return the song ids and playcount
    return song_ids, playcount
```

## Music Streaming
The second Music AI business model is music streaming. This model uses AI to enhance user experience by creating and managing personalized playlists based on the user's mood and occasion. To implement this model, we need an AI-powered music streaming platform that can analyze user's emotions and create playlists based on them. Here's an example of Python code that uses sentiment analysis to create a playlist based on user's moods:

```
import spotipy
from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyClientCredentials
from textblob import TextBlob

# Authenticate with Spotify API
client_credentials_manager = SpotifyClientCredentials(client_id='YOUR_CLIENT_ID', client_secret='YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET')
sp = spotipy.Spotify(client_credentials_manager=client_credentials_manager)

# Get user's top artists
def get_top_artists(user_id):
    results = sp.current_user_top_artists()
    return results['items']

# Get user's playlists
def get_user_playlists(user_id):
    results = sp.user_playlists(user_id)
    return results['items']

# Create playlist based on user's sentiment
def create_playlist(user_id):
    # Get user's top artists
    artists = get_top_artists(user_id)
    
    # Get user's sentiment for each artist
    sentiments = []
    for artist in artists:
        lyrics = get_lyrics(artist)
        sentiment = TextBlob(lyrics).sentiment.polarity 
        sentiments.append(sentiment)
    
    # Calculate the average sentiment
    avg_sentiment = sum(sentiments)/len(sentiments)
    
    # Create playlist based on sentiment
    if avg_sentiment > 0:
        sp.user_playlist_create(user_id, name='Happy Playlist', public=True)
    elif avg_sentiment < 0:
        sp.user_playlist_create(user_id, name='Sad Playlist', public=True)
    else:
        sp.user_playlist_create(user_id, name='Neutral Playlist', public=True)
``` 

## Music Composition
The third Music AI business model is music composition. This model uses AI-powered tools to help musicians compose music to their specific needs. To implement this model, we need an AI-powered music composition software that can generate music based on user's inputs. Here's an example of Python code that generates music using LSTMs (a type of neural network):

```
import keras
import numpy as np
from music21 import *

# Load the music data
music_data = converter.parse("music.xml")

# Transform the music data into a numpy array
music_array = np.array(music_data)

# Create a LSTM model for music generation
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(256, input_shape=(music_array.shape[1], music_array.shape[2]), return_sequences=True),
    Dropout(0.3),
    LSTM(512),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(music_array.shape[2]),
    Activation('softmax')
])

# Load the pretrained weights
model.load_weights("weights.h5")

# Generate music using the LSTM model
def generate_music():
    # Set the seed sequence for the LSTM model
    seed_seq = music_array[:10]
    
    # Generate the music sequence using the LSTM model
    generated_seq = []
    for i in range(30):
        pred = model.predict(seed_seq)
        pred = np.argmax(pred, axis=1)
        generated_seq.append(pred)
        seed_seq = np.append(seed_seq, pred.reshape((1, 1, 1)), axis=0)[1:]

    # Transform the generated sequence into a music file
    music_stream = stream.Stream()
    for note in generated_seq:
        music_stream.append(note)

    music_stream.write("midi", fp="music.mid")
``` 

## Royalties Collection
The final Music AI business model we discussed is royalties collection. This model uses AI to track musiciansâ€™ music rights and collect royalties on their behalf. To implement this model, we need a blockchain-based solution that can help track transactions related to music rights and royalties. Here's an example of Python code that uses blockchain technology to manage music rights and royalties:

```
from hashlib import sha256

class Block:
    def __init__(self, index, data, previous_hash):
        self.index = index
        self.timestamp = datetime.datetime.now()
        self.data = data
        self.previous_hash = previous_hash
        self.hash = self.calculate_hash()

    def calculate_hash(self):
        return sha256((str(self.index) + str(self.timestamp) + str(self.data) + str(self.previous_hash)).encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()

class Blockchain:
    def __init__(self):
        self.chain = [self.create_genesis_block()]

    def create_genesis_block(self):
        return Block(0, "Genesis Block", "0")

    def add_block(self, data):
        block = Block(len(self.chain), data, self.chain[-1].hash)
        self.chain.append(block)
```

These are just a few examples of how we can implement Music AI business models in code. Depending on the needs and objectives of your Music AI company, you may need to create more complex algorithms and models to ensure success. So, have fun exploring and creating code to build your Music AI business!
