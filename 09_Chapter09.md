## Chapter 9: Creating Your First Music AI Model

Alice yawned and rubbed her eyes as she wandered through the garden of her dreams. She had just travelled through a wild and wacky journey to find the tools and technologies she needed to start her very own music AI company. Now, she was ready for the next step: creating her first music AI model.

As she walked through the garden, she spotted a huge, colorful caterpillar sitting atop a mushroom. The caterpillar was puffing on a hookah and seemed to be in a rather contemplative mood.

"Excuse me," said Alice, "can you help me create my first music AI model? I'm not quite sure where to begin."

"I can certainly try," replied the caterpillar in a slurred, trippy voice. "But first, you must create a world of sound."

"A world of sound?" asked Alice, confused.

"Yes, a world of sound," said the caterpillar. "You must collect all the sounds in the world and organize them in a way that the AI can understand and interpret."

Alice nodded, unsure of how to collect all the sounds in the world. Just as she was about to speak up, the caterpillar continued.

"Once you have created your world of sound, it's time to give it a voice. You'll need to feed your AI system with hours of music compositions in different styles, genres, and tempos. The AI system will then learn and understand these compositions and use them to generate new ones," said the caterpillar, blowing smoke rings as he spoke.

Alice listened intently, realizing she had a lot of work ahead of her. But she was determined to create the most innovative and unique music compositions with her music AI company.

"With a world of sound and a trained AI system, it's time to start generating music pieces," said the caterpillar. "You can create a generative model that generates new pieces of music based on the inputs you give it. Or, you can create a predictive model that predicts what note or melody comes next based on the notes and melodies that came before it."

Alice was amazed by the possibilities of music AI modeling. She thanked the caterpillar and continued on her journey, excited to start creating her first music AI model.

As she walked away, she thought back to the caterpillar's advice. Creating a world of sound, training the AI system, and generating music pieces - it was a lot of work, but she knew it would all be worth it. Alice couldn't wait to see what innovative and unique music compositions her music AI company would generate.
# Explanation of Code Samples

Creating a music AI model can be a complex process, but it's made easier with the right tools and technologies. In this chapter, we'll walk through some code samples to help you create your first music AI model.

**1. Creating a World of Sound**

Before you can even begin to generate music compositions, you need to create a world of sound. This involves collecting all the sounds in the world and organizing them in a way that your AI system can understand and interpret.

Here's some code samples to help you create your world of sound:

```python
import librosa

def load_audio(path):
    y, sr = librosa.load(path, sr=44100)
    return y, sr

def extract_features(y, sr):
    chroma_stft = librosa.feature.chroma_stft(y=y, sr=sr)
    return chroma_stft

def create_dataset(path_to_songs):
    X = []
    for song in path_to_songs:
        y, sr = load_audio(song)
        chroma_stft = extract_features(y, sr)
        X.append(chroma_stft)
    X = np.array(X)
    return X
```

This code will load each music file, extract its chroma features, and return a dataset of all the chroma features from all the music files. This dataset can be used to train your AI system.

**2. Training the AI System**

Once you have your world of sound, it's time to train your AI system. This process involves feeding your AI system with hours of music compositions in different styles, genres, and tempos. Your AI system will learn and understand these compositions and use them to generate new ones.

Here's some code samples to help you train your AI system:

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, LSTM
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def train_model(X):
    y = np.roll(X, -1, axis=1)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    X_train = np.expand_dims(X_train, axis=2)
    X_test = np.expand_dims(X_test, axis=2)
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(LSTM(units=128, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2]), return_sequences=True))
    model.add(Dense(units=128, activation='relu'))
    model.add(LSTM(units=128, return_sequences=True))
    model.add(Dense(units=128, activation='relu'))
    model.add(LSTM(units=128))
    model.add(Dense(units=X_train.shape[2]))
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
    history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
    return history
```

This code will train a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model using your dataset of chroma features. The model will be trained to predict what note or melody comes next based on the notes and melodies that came before it.

**3. Generating Music Pieces**

Once your AI system is trained, it's time to start generating music pieces! You can create a generative model that generates new pieces of music based on the inputs you give it. Or, you can create a predictive model that predicts what note or melody comes next based on the notes and melodies that came before it.

Here's some code samples to help you generate music pieces:

```python
def generate_music(predictor, length):
    seed = np.random.rand(1, 12, 1)
    predicted = []
    for i in range(length):
        prediction = predictor.predict(seed)
        predicted.append(prediction[0][-1])
        seed = np.concatenate((seed[:, 1:, :], prediction), axis=1)
    return predicted
```

This code will generate a new music piece by predicting the next note or melody based on the previous notes and melodies. The `seed` array is the initial input, and the `length` parameter defines how many notes/melodies to generate.

With these code samples, you have everything you need to create your very own music AI model. Good luck and have fun exploring the wonderful world of music AI!
