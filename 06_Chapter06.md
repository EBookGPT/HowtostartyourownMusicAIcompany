# Chapter 6: Understanding Music Copyright and Licenses

Welcome back to our journey of creating a Music AI Company! In the previous chapter, we talked about finding your place in the music industry. This chapter is devoted to understanding music copyrights and licenses, as they are fundamental to any music-related business.

To guide us in this discussion, we have the pleasure of welcoming a special guest, Lawyer Donald Passman. Mr. Passman is a well-known figure in the music industry, having represented clients such as Taylor Swift, Adele, and Maroon 5. He has also written several influential books, including "All You Need to Know About the Music Business."

Music copyrights are laws that protect the rights of the creators of original music. As someone starting a music-related business, it's crucial to understand these laws, as they dictate what you can and cannot do with music. For example, without the proper license, it's illegal to use copyrighted music in any commercial context. 

Different types of licenses allow for different types of use. It's essential to know the different types of licenses and what they permit. The two main types of licenses are mechanical and synchronization licenses. Mechanical licenses are for audio-only recordings, while synchronization licenses allow for music to be placed in visual media, such as movies or TV shows.

Mr. Passman advises that you should always educate yourself on the nuances of music copyright laws before starting a business. For a deeper understanding of the topic, we recommend reading his book, "All You Need to Know About the Music Business."

As we move forward in our journey, remember to always do your research on music-related laws and stay informed about any changes in the legal landscape. It's essential for the success of your business and the well-being of the music industry as a whole. 

```python
# Sample code for obtaining a synchronization license
import requests

api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
movie_title = "Back to the Future"
song_title = "The Power of Love"
artist_name = "Huey Lewis and the News"
url = f"https://api.musixmatch.com/ws/1.1/track.search?q_artist={artist_name}&q_track={song_title}&apikey={api_key}"
response = requests.get(url).json()

track_id = response["message"]["body"]["track_list"][0]["track"]["track_id"]
movie_id = get_movie_id(movie_title)

url = f"https://api.musixmatch.com/ws/1.1/track.subtitle.get?track_id={track_id}&subtitle_format=srt&apikey={api_key}"
response = requests.get(url).json()

lyrics = response["message"]["body"]["subtitle"]["subtitle_body"]

# Chapter 6: Understanding Music Copyright and Licenses

Alice rubbed her eyes and took a deep breath, trying to make sense of the strange new world she had found herself in.

As she wandered through the bizarre landscape, she stumbled upon a tea party. Sat at the table was a rather peculiar looking man with a sly smile on his face. "Welcome, my dear," he said. "I am Lawyer Donald Passman. Tell me, what brings you to this curious place?"

Alice explained that she was on a quest to start her own Music AI company. She had heard that the Mad Hatter had some advice on music-related laws, and she was hoping to meet him. "Well, my dear, you're in luck!" said Mr. Passman. "I know all about music copyrights and licenses, and I'd be happy to help you."

As they sipped their tea, Mr. Passman began to explain the intricacies of music-related laws. He told Alice that music copyrights were laws that protected the rights of the creators of original music. Without the proper license, it was illegal to use copyrighted music in any commercial context.

Alice was confused, so Mr. Passman pulled out a book from his pocket called "All You Need to Know About the Music Business" and handed it to her. As Alice flipped through the pages, she learned about different types of licenses for music use, such as mechanical and synchronization licenses.

Mr. Passman explained the differences between the two, emphasizing that mechanical licenses were for audio-only recordings, while synchronization licenses allowed for music to be placed in visual media, such as movies or TV shows.

Feeling more informed, Alice thanked Mr. Passman and continued on her journey towards finding the Mad Hatter. As she went, she made sure to keep in mind the importance of understanding music-related laws before starting her own business.

```python
# Sample code for obtaining a synchronization license
import requests

api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
movie_title = "Back to the Future"
song_title = "The Power of Love"
artist_name = "Huey Lewis and the News"
url = f"https://api.musixmatch.com/ws/1.1/track.search?q_artist={artist_name}&q_track={song_title}&apikey={api_key}"
response = requests.get(url).json()

track_id = response["message"]["body"]["track_list"][0]["track"]["track_id"]
movie_id = get_movie_id(movie_title)

url = f"https://api.musixmatch.com/ws/1.1/track.subtitle.get?track_id={track_id}&subtitle_format=srt&apikey={api_key}"
response = requests.get(url).json()

lyrics = response["message"]["body"]["subtitle"]["subtitle_body"]
generate_video(lyrics, movie_id)
```

Alice couldn't wait to put her new knowledge into practice and build a successful Music AI company.
In the Alice in Wonderland trippy story, Alice learns about the importance of understanding music-related laws before starting her own Music AI company. Specifically, she learns about music copyrights and licenses, including different types of licenses like mechanical and synchronization licenses.

As an illustration of a synchronization license, the story includes a code snippet for obtaining a synchronization license for a song called "The Power of Love" by Huey Lewis and the News, to be used in the movie "Back to the Future." Here's a brief explanation of the code:

```python
import requests

api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
movie_title = "Back to the Future"
song_title = "The Power of Love"
artist_name = "Huey Lewis and the News"

# Query the Musixmatch API for the requested song
url = f"https://api.musixmatch.com/ws/1.1/track.search?q_artist={artist_name}&q_track={song_title}&apikey={api_key}"
response = requests.get(url).json()

# Extract the track ID from the API response
track_id = response["message"]["body"]["track_list"][0]["track"]["track_id"]

# Get the ID of the requested movie
movie_id = get_movie_id(movie_title)

# Query the Musixmatch API for the song's lyrics
url = f"https://api.musixmatch.com/ws/1.1/track.subtitle.get?track_id={track_id}&subtitle_format=srt&apikey={api_key}"
response = requests.get(url).json()

# Extract the lyrics from the API response
lyrics = response["message"]["body"]["subtitle"]["subtitle_body"]

# Generate a video with the song's lyrics over scenes from the movie
generate_video(lyrics, movie_id)
```

The code makes use of the Musixmatch API, which provides metadata and lyrics for millions of songs. The API requires an API key, which is passed in as the `api_key` variable.

The first part of the code constructs a query URL based on the requested song and artist, and sends a GET request to the Musixmatch API using the `requests` library. The API response is in JSON format, which is stored in the `response` variable. The API response contains a list of tracks that match the query, and the code extracts the track ID of the first track in the list.

The code then calls a function called `get_movie_id` to get the ID of the requested movie. This is not shown in the code snippet, but would likely involve querying a movie database API like IMDb.

Next, the code constructs a new query URL to get the lyrics for the song based on the track ID from the previous step. It sends another GET request to the Musixmatch API and stores the lyrics in the `lyrics` variable.

Finally, the code calls a function called `generate_video`, which is presumably defined elsewhere in the code base. This function generates a video that combines the song's lyrics with scenes from the requested movie, creating a synchronized music video that could be used in a commercial context with the proper synchronization license.
